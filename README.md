PluginCore has been deprecated, but it still exists on GitHub for projects
which have it as a third-party submodule. The old source code can be found in
the "2.1" tag.

If you are looking for a good library to use for cross-platform audio plugin
programming, I recommend [Juce][1] instead, which is what the Teragon Audio
plugins now use.
